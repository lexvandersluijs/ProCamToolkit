This is my fork of [ProCamToolkit](https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/ProCamToolkit) by Kyle McDonald. I'm doing some experiments, and am currently implementing support for multiple projectors connected to one computer. This is in the multi-projector branch, and it is by no means finished. I use GitHub to safely store my changes on-line, so please do not assume that anything other than what is in the master branch works.

For more information about the project itself, please visit the root repository by YCAMInterlab.
